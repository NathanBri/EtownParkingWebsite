# EtownParkingWebsite
Overview: A website to show applicable parking spots at Elizabethtown College based on your year.

This project will be designed to help students, faculty, and guests navigate the Elizabethtown College parking permissions. 
A user will be able to view a map, imput their student status, whether they are an employee, or a guest, and have their applicable parking lots highlighted for them.
The user will then be able to click on a highlighted spot to view more details about the time and days, and more information about parking there.

This program will not need to be installed, and will be accessed through park.etowndb.com

Once the program is developed we will have instructions for use here:
